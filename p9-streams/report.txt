Example Execution:

cs2203:llm009:~/p9-streams$ ./stream

Setting up the problem...0.001289 s
    Vector size = 10000
Allocating device variables...0.000224 s

Running WITHOUT streams..101.500931 s
Verifying WITHOUT streams results 0...TEST PASSED
Verifying WITHOUT streams results 1...TEST PASSED

Running WITH streams..56.186344 s
Verifying WITH streams results 0...TEST PASSED
Verifying WITH streams results 1...TEST PASSED






As you can see the execution without out streams took around 102 seconds and the execution with streams took around 56 seconds. This is around a 1.8x speed up when using multiple streams in this case.
